This project contains the basic structure and syntax for a simple REST API built in Express.

Exemplified methods: 
- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `DELETE`

We've also implemented basic JSON response in `global error handlers`, including a global `404` handler.

This implements data-store using a custom ORM-like syntax but you could easily substitue these methods for another ORM (`Sequelize`?)
